    <h1>Brandan Pratt</h1>

    <p>I am a Software Engineer.</p>
</header>
    <p>I am currently pursuing my Associates Degree at The Bahamas Technical and Vocational Institution.
        I am also a part-time software developer at Bahamas First General Insurance. I chose to be a programmer
        because of my love for videogames, and that its a challenging career where you get to build, and constantly
        learn. As time goes on I will be adding more to my website/portfolio.</p>
